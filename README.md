### Machine Learning
[Road Accident Serverity](https://github.com/Ishaqinu/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Road%20accidents%20severity.ipynb) : The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms

[Car Details](https://github.com/Ishaqinu/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/car%20details.ipynb) : IN this model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the Linear regression model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

[Laptop Price Prediction](https://github.com/Ishaqinu/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/laptop%20price%20prediction.ipynb) : This notebook is about the Price Prediction of a dataset contaning data about laptops. We'll use pandas, numpy and other python packages for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization & Regression model are used make ml models.
model used:
* linear regression
* KNeighbor
* DecisionTree
* RandomForest
* SVM

[Stock Price Predicition](https://github.com/Ishaqinu/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/project%20nestle.ipynb) : Before Investing into any company an investor should study Historical stock Prices of that company , analyze the Opening-closing and High/Low dPrices for better understanding of the performance of that company in share markets. Here we are predicting the Closing Price of Nestle Shares with the available Independent Features.
From this Data we can get to know :
* Which Feature or Features are significant in predicting the close Price.
* How well those Features describe the Close price of this Company.
