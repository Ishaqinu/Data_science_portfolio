[Road Accident Serverity](https://github.com/Ishaqinu/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Road%20accidents%20severity.ipynb) : The project is a data analysis project that investigates the severity of road accidents .This project uses a dataset of over 400,000 road accidents to identify factors that are associated with more severe accidents. The project includes the following steps:
*Importing and cleaning the data
*Exploratory data analysis
*Feature engineering
*Model selection and training
*Evaluation of the model

Also finds that the following factors are associated with more severe accidents:
\nThe number of vehicles involved in the accident
*The number of fatalities in the accident
*The severity of the injuries in the accident
*The weather conditions at the time of the accident
*The time of day of the accident
*The road conditions at the time of the accident
concludes that the factors identified in the project can be used to develop models that can predict the severity of road accidents. These models can be used to improve road safety by identifying areas where interventions are needed.

Here are some additional details about the project:
*The data used in the project was obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
*The project was written in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment.
*The project is open source and can be downloaded from GitHub.
*I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
